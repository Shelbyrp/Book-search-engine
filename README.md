## Description

This application was provided as a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API. It has been refactored to now use a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It allows users to save book searches to the back end.
